make
./solver <initial file> <completeness>

<initial file> is the file for the initial stacks

<completeness> determines the chance the solver will stop the solution early
	for example...
	100 will give the solver a 1% chance of ending the solution early
	200 ... a 0.5% chance
	400 ... a 0.25% chance
	2 ... a 50% chance
	0 ... will let the program choose a chance every time it creates a solution
		between [1, 200]
	

1) get the result of (rand() % completeness + stack_count)
	if it's equal to 0 then return the solution, goto step 6

2) pick from a random stack that is too large
	append the index of the stack to the solution

3) get the result of (rand() % completeness + stack_count)
	if it's equal to 0 then return the solution, goto step 6

4) drop onto a random stack that is too small
	append the index of the stack to the solution

5) if there are any remaining stacks that are too large, goto step 1

6) goto step 1, 100000 times

-- How to Run --
make
./a.out <size>

<size> is the number of desired games, this number should be 3 or greater


-- My Algorithm -- Variable Neighborhood Search --

1) Generate a random solution

2) In the current neighborhood, make a random change and accept it.
	This change and current fitness are now the best for the neighborhood.

3) Wiggle around the neighborhood, and find better solutions.

4) After a while of not finding anything better, iterate the neighborhood.
	This new neighborhood starts with the best solution from the previous neighborhood.

5) After iterating through all the neighborhoods for a while, randomize the entire solution.
